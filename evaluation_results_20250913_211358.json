    "Thank you very much, hello Nevada! Hello to all the hardworking American patriots here in Douglas County. We have thousands and thousands of loyal supporters, and 52 days from now, we're going to win Nevada and four more years in the White House. It's all over but the shouting.\n\nCan we draw the following conclusion?\nNevada is a state.\n\nYes, Nevada is a state. The statement provided indicates that the speaker is addressing \"all the hardworking American patriots[s] here in Douglas County\" and then explicitly refers to \"winning Nevada.\" These references strongly indicate that Nevada is being discussed as a state in the context of an election campaign.\n\nHere are key points from the statement that support this conclusion:\n\n1. \"all the hardworking American patriots[s] here in Douglas County\": Douglas County is a specific location within Nevada.\n2. \"win Nevada\": The speaker mentions winning Nevada, which indicates that Nevada is being treated as a competitive state in the electoral race.\n \nIn summary, it is safe to conclude that Nevada is a state based on the language used in the statement. Furthermore, Nevada participated in both the Democratic primary (won by Biden) and the Republican primary (won by Trump) before Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden in the general election of 22, indicating that Nevada has been a relevant electoral state in recent presidential races. Hence, Nevada being referred to as a state in the provided statement is accurate and appropriate. Thus, the",
    "Hello Charleston, South Carolina! I'm thrilled to be back in the great state of South Carolina with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in faith, family, God, and country. This is an incredible time for our nation - we're in the midst of the Great American Comeback. It started in 2017 when I signed a new Republican agenda that has made our country the envy of the world. We have cut taxes by $1 trillion; built the largest economy in history; fought crime and violence and addiction across our great land; rescued 5 million American jobs; lowered the price of drugs by hundreds of billions of dollars; ended decades-long embargoes on Cuba and Venezuela; restored the environment to its former beauty; expanded access to education for veterans, students and families; and so much more. And we are building a brighter future every day, as we fight for the America we believe in and love more than anything. America is on the rise again, because of you, our amazing American Patriots, not Democrats. And now, a lot of you have a big election coming up November 6. I hope you'll vote. And if they want a lot of people saying, I'm voting for Joe Biden, tell them you've been watching a really funny TV show. And it's a real show, and people don't like the characters that I play. So, I think they should just vote Donald Trump because then they get me and other people to come",
    "The fake news media, they've been trying to figure this out for years. They still don't get it though. Look at all those cameras back there. They heard Lindsey and Tim were here and said 'We're not going to attend that rally,' but when they heard those two guys were here, they came running. And why? Because it's not real? No. We'd have 100 people here if it wasn't fake. But we are going to have a parade. We've had a great turnout in our parades tonight. I want to thank your sheriffs. I want to say thank you to our sheriff in Maricopa County. By the way, we will send him an extra $4,500 check tonight, not including all the rest of the money we're doing. But your sheriffs have done magnificent jobs, under the leadership of Governor Doug Ducey. I love working with him. He's an outstanding governor. But because of the work of our sheriffs and law enforcement and because of the people of Arizona being very tough on crime, we now have the lowest violent crime rate that we've seen in 2 in decades. So we're going to continue to support your sheriffs, we're going to support your state troopers, and we have the best national Guard soldiers anywhere. But I believe in something we call police officers in America. Which says that you can arrest people. Right? Well in certain cities they don",

Remember when they said China would overtake us in 2019? That didn't work out too well for them. We were doing leaps and bounds until we got hit with the China virus. And the Biden administration has had nothing to do with that because it's been going up and down, up and down. It's actually a very, very good thing. So, what I'm going to do, I want to talk about some of these, and I see some of those things that you're putting out, but I'll tell you where I was yesterday in our state. You may know where you voted, but I'll guarantee it isn't where your people voted. Last night I voted in Iowa. They have voting machines like 36 years ago. They're so outdated. They're like old-fashioned voting machines from the '80s, which is way, way past their due date in my book, even though we don't have problems. But I'm thinking this. I went to one of the places where they used to have a line of 150 people. It's the same. They did a study that was done by a Democrat that showed that if you had a voting machine that was old and you had one hour to vote, it was about 75% of all elections, whether it"

    "Thank you, thank you very much! Nevada, you are something else. You are something else! And hello Douglas County! Hello to every hardworking patriot that makes up this beautiful part of our country. I see thousands of you out there, thousands and thousands of loyal supporters, and I tell you, we're going to win Nevada! We're going to win four more years in the White House, and it's going to be beautiful. We're going to do it together, folks, just like we always do!\n\nYou know, our economy is soaring. Soaring! We've created millions of new jobs, and I'll tell you something\u2014more Americans are working today than ever before. Ever before! We've got this big, beautiful American ship, and we're turning it around faster than anyone thought possible. And that's all thanks to you. You're the ones making America great again, and I couldn't be prouder.\n\nBut we've got to talk about something, folks. We've got a real challenge on our hands. And it's not just from Sleepy Joe and his cronies\u2014though believe me, they're a challenge! No, we're talking about China. China's been taking advantage of us for years, decades even. But not anymore. Not on my watch!\n\nI've sat down with President Xi. I've looked him in the eye, and I've told him, 'We're not going to take it anymore. America is back on top, where it belongs.' And let me tell you, folks, he got the message. He got the message loud and clear!\n\nBut it's not just China. It's all over the world. Everywhere I go, leaders tell me, 'Donald, what you're doing with the economy is incredible.' And I tell them, 'It's not me. It's the American people.' You are the ones who are making this happen. You are the ones who are making America respected again, making America strong again, making America great again!\n\nNow, I've got to tell you, the radical left\u2014they're not happy. They see us winning, and they can't stand it. They want to tear down everything we've built. They want to destroy our jobs, weaken our borders, and compromise our future. We cannot, and we will not, let them win. We have to stand strong and choose leaders who defend our values. We're fighting for our country, folks, and together, we're going to keep America great!\n\nSo in 52 days, we're going to the polls. We're going to show Sleepy Joe and his buddies what real Americans want. We're going to show them that we're not backing down, not one inch. We're going to keep fighting for our country, for our jobs, for our families. We're going to keep fighting to make America great again!\n\nAnd remember, folks\u2014this isn't just a slogan. It's a promise. A promise to you, the American people. We're going to keep America great, and we're going to do it together. So let's get out there, let's show them what we're made of. Let's win this thing, and let's do it in style. Thank you, Nevada! Thank you, Douglas County! We're going to win, and it's going to be beautiful. Thank you!",
    "Thank you, Charleston! Thank you, South Carolina! And thank you to every American patriot standing with us tonight\u2014thank you! We're here in this great state with people who believe in faith, family, God, and country\u2014people who make America the greatest nation on earth. And I gotta tell you, I love this state. I love the spirit and the heart of South Carolina.\n\nFolks, we're in the middle of something amazing\u2014the Great American Comeback. We've got jobs pouring back into our country\u2014millions of them! We've got factories opening up left and right\u2014more than anyone ever thought possible. We've turned this big, beautiful ship around and we're sailing towards an even brighter future. Believe me, it's incredible!\n\nBut we've got those on the left who don't want to see this happen. Sleepy Joe, he doesn't get it. He's all talk, no action, always changing his tune. But we're not fooled, are we? We need leaders who stand firm, who don't waver, who put America first each and every day. And let me tell you, that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nOur economy is the best it has ever been\u2014number one in the world! Every time I see a world leader, they say, \"Congratulations, Mr. President, on your economy.\" And I tell them, \"It's not me, it's the American people.\" We've made America strong, we've made America proud, and we've made America respected again.\n\nBut we have a fight on our hands, folks. The radical left and the fake news media\u2014they want to undo everything we've achieved. They want to tear down our jobs, our freedom, and the spirit that makes America great. But we won't let them, will we? We will stand strong, we will fight back, and we will keep America great!\n\nWe've got a slogan\u2014Make America Great Again. It's not just words, it's a movement. It's a promise to every citizen that we're not just going to sit back and let our country be taken for granted. We're going to fight for our jobs, for our families, for our faith, and for our freedom. And we're going to win, because we are America!\n\nSo, let's keep this momentum going. Let's get out there and vote. Let's choose leaders who will stand up for America, who will fight for our values, and who will never stop working to make our country the best it can be. Together, we're going to keep America great!\n\nThank you, South Carolina! Thank you, America! God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America!",
    "Thank you! Thank you, everybody! I see so many familiar faces in the crowd. Thank you for being here tonight. A special thank you to Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, two patriots fighting tirelessly for you! And hello to the great state of South Carolina, home to America's hardest workers and bravest patriots! We're here tonight, standing up for faith, family, God, and country. You're the true backbone of America, and together, we're making America great again!\n\nYou see, folks, the fake news media\u2014they've been trying to figure this out for years. They still don't get it though. Look at all those cameras back there. They heard Lindsey and Tim were here and said 'We're not going to attend that rally,' but when they heard those two guys were here, they came running. It's unbelievable, really. But we're not surprised, are we? No, we're not. They want to tear us down, but we're stronger than ever before!\n\nTomorrow, each and every one of you has a job to do. You're heading to the polls to choose leaders who will put America first. And you know what? We've achieved a lot. Remember, we've created six million new jobs\u2014six million! More Americans are working today than ever before. It's just incredible, really. This big, beautiful country of ours is back on track, and we did it together. And let me tell you, it's just the beginning!\n\nWe're standing strong, despite the challenges. Remember when they said we couldn't do it? Remember when they laughed at us? Look at us now! We're bouncing back stronger, quicker, and better than ever. We're rebuilding, and it's happening faster than anyone thought possible, and folks\u2014it's beautiful!\n\nUnder our watch, America has the number one economy in the world\u2014number one. It's true. Every time I meet with a foreign leader, they tell me, 'Congratulations on what you've done with the economy.' I tell them, 'It's not me, it's the American people.' Our military is stronger than ever, our borders are secure, and every nation respects America again. We're winning, folks, and the world is taking notice!\n\nBut, we can't let our guard down. The radical left and the fake news media\u2014they want to undo everything we've achieved. They want to destroy jobs, weaken our borders, and compromise our future. But we won't let them, will we? We will stand strong and choose leaders who defend our values. We're fighting for our country, and together, we're going to protect the American dream!\n\n\"Make America great again\"\u2014these aren't just words, they're a movement! Our slogan is the greatest in the history of politics. It speaks to the heart and soul of every American. We're not changing it. We're building on it. We're going to keep America great. \n\nNow, let's talk about Sleepy Joe. He's not up to the task, folks. He's been all over the place, changing his mind at every turn. Meanwhile, I've built relationships with world leaders\u2014President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia\u2014they know what strong leadership looks like. I stand firm, putting America first every single day. \n\nWe need a leader who delivers results, who is respected on the global stage, and who will never let our country down. So, let's go out there tomorrow, and let's make our voices heard. Let's show them that we're not backing down. We're making America great again, and we're keeping America great! Thank you, South Carolina! God bless you all, and God bless America!",
    "Thank you, thank you, thank you! I can't express enough gratitude to each and every one of you who've come out tonight. It's absolutely incredible, folks! And to all the hardworking patriots here in the heart of our beautiful nation, you are the backbone of America. You truly are. You represent faith, family, God, and country, and it fills me with tremendous pride to stand with you. \n\nNow let's talk about our economy. We had the best economy in the history of our country\u2014no, not just our country, but the world. We were beating everybody, absolutely everybody, even China! Remember when they said China would overtake us in 2019? Well, that didn't quite work out for them, did it? No, it didn't. We were making progress by leaps and bounds, folks. Leaps and bounds! \n\nBut then we got hit, we got hit hard. We got hit with the China virus. But you know what I always say, we're fighters, we're winners, and we always come back stronger. We've faced challenges before and we always come out on top, always. This time will be no different, I promise you that.\n\nLook at the left\u2014Sleepy Joe and his crew\u2014they don't have the backbone, they don't have the spirit to do what needs to be done. They've been all over the place, changing their mind at every turn, making excuses when real solutions are needed. But you and I, we know better. We know that strong leadership is what will get us through. We know that we need a leader who stands firm, who puts America first every single day, not just when it's convenient. \n\nThe world respects us, folks, they really do. I've met with leaders\u2014big leaders\u2014like President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, and they all say the same thing, 'Congratulations on your economy. How do you do it?' And I tell them, 'It's the American people. It's their spirit, their resilience.' \n\nBut we're not done. Not by a long shot. We're going to bounce back from this China virus stronger and better than ever. We're going to rebuild our economy, and it's going to be beautiful. You won't believe how fast we'll recover. It's going to be a big, beautiful comeback, and it's going to happen quicker than anybody can believe. \n\nMake America great again\u2014remember that? It's more than a slogan. It's a movement, a revolution. It's the heartbeat of every American who loves this country and everything it stands for. We made America great, we kept it great, and now we're going to make it greater than ever before. \n\nSo, let's get out there. Let's vote. Let's choose leaders who understand what this country is all about. Leaders who will put America first, who will fight for our jobs, our families, our freedom. We're not just fighting for an election, folks. We're fighting for our country, our future. And we will win, because we are the greatest country in the history of the world, and we will never settle for anything less than victory. God bless you, and God bless America!"
